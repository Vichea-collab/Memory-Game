# 1. EXCLUDE all Unity serialization and metadata files
# These are the files that falsely inflate the ShaderLab count.
*.mat linguist-vendored
*.asset linguist-vendored
*.prefab linguist-vendored
*.unity linguist-vendored
*.meta linguist-vendored

# 2. EXCLUDE all other non-C# development files
# This makes C# count even higher by ignoring other common files:
*.json linguist-vendored  # Package manifests, build settings, etc.
*.asmdef linguist-vendored # Assembly definition files
*.shader linguist-vendored # You can even ignore your own shader code to prioritize C# (Use only if you want C# to be 95%+)
*.hlsl linguist-vendored
*.cginc linguist-vendored
*.txt linguist-vendored
*.md linguist-vendored # Readme files
*.xml linguist-vendored # Configuration files

# 3. EXPLICITLY COUNT C#
# This ensures that all your game logic files are correctly identified.
*.cs linguist-language=C#
